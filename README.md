**HOW TO USE AWS COGNITO FOR AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION**

In this project I've configured AWS COGNITO in "Federation Identity mode" using COGNITO as Idp.

Before to start the project remember to set the correct parameters in config.js and create 
an user on cognito's user pool.

For starting the project:

`$ npm install`

`$ npm start`
